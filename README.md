# On The Map

## Overview
User will create an app with a map that shows information **posted** by other students. The map will contain **pins** that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be **geocoded** to a location, and a URL.

## What did I learn
* Accessing networked data using Apple’s URL loading framework
* Authenticating a user using over a network connection
* Creating user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
* Use Core Location and the MapKit framework for to display annotated pins on a map

## Why is this project meaningful to me
- This project will give me an opportunity to _post_ and _retrieve_ data from a **network** resource using Apple’s networking framework. It will also allow me to practice **authenticating** a user.
- Working with data from networked sources is as important to iOS development as creating good _user interfaces_. Completing this project shows that a developer can both read and write from **RESTful** networked **APIs**.
